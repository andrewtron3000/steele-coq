# steele-coq

This repository is a Coq development related to the talk by Guy L. Steele entitled "Four Solutions to a Trivial Problem".  The talk illustrates some algorithmic differences between sequential and parallel algorithm development.  Guy develops an associative "oplus" operator and asks whether "oplus" is associative.  This Coq development attempts to investigate that question.
